# Field Day Theme Installation

I love colors, so I created themes based on the colors in my EC2 Field Day course. Feel free to install if you want your stuff to look like mine!

## Font

I use [Overpass Mono](https://ryanlewis.link/overpass-mono) all over.

Download and install the whole family for best effect.

## Terminal

For my terminal setup, I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) and [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/). Each tool requires different installation steps.

### iTerm2

FieldDay.itermcolors
Overpass Mono font
- Bold
105 line height

### oh my zsh

fieldday.zsh-theme
